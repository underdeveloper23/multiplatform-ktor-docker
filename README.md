# Full-Stack Application with PostgreSQL Database

This full-stack application is a sample project that demonstrates the usage of Kotlin, Ktor, Exposed (a lightweight SQL library), and PostgreSQL to build a web-based application with database functionality. The project includes modules related to user management and consent handling, as well as region-specific localised politics requirements.

## Features

- User management with CRUD operations.
- User login and authentication.
- Tenant management.
- Region-specific localised politics requirements.
- User consent tracking.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd fullstack-application
   ```

## Prerequisites:

2. **Install PostgreSQL**
Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the connection details in the Application.kt file.

2. **Build and Run the Application**

    ```bash
    Copy code
    ./gradlew run
    ```

This will start the application on http://localhost:8080. You can access the application via a web browser or use API endpoints for testing.

## API Documentation:

The application provides various RESTful API endpoints for user and tenant management. You can find detailed documentation for these endpoints in the source code comments in the Application.kt file.

### Usage
User Management: Use the provided API endpoints to create, read, update, and delete user records in the database.

### User Login: 
Implement user login and authentication using the `/api/users/login endpoint`.

### Tenant Management: 
Manage tenants with the `/api/tenants` and `/api/tenants/switch` endpoints.

### Localised Politics Requirements: 
The application supports region-specific localised politics requirements. You can extend this functionality by creating custom modules for different regions as demonstrated in the UserPlugin class.

## Customization
The application provides flexibility for customizing the localised politics requirements based on regions. You can create your own region-specific modules by implementing the Module and ConsentType interfaces. Use the UserPlugin to register and manage these modules.
